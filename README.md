## Metadata database

The file "Eremophila_ChemoEvo_metadata.tsv" contains metadata about leaf morphology (resin and hairiness), environmental factors (pollination and geographical distribution) and medicinal properties (traditional medicinal uses and antibacterial studies).

The information presented here accounts for 291 specimen of Eremophila and allied genera. The tab separated tsv file is linked to the corresponding spectral data available at https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?accession=MSV000086644 and can be directly used within a GNPS workflow.

The datapoints are to be interpreted as follows:

**Leaf resin:** "0" - absence; "1" - presence

**Leaf hairiness:** "0" - absence; "1" - presence

**Pollination:** "0" - insect; "1" - bird

**Traditional use:** "0" - no documented use; "1" - use is documented

**Antibacterial activity:** "0" - tested absence of activity; "1" - tested presence of activity (corresponding references are found in Table S1 of the manuscript)

**Biogeographical distribution:** "0" - widespread; "1" - eremean; "2" - southwestern temperate; "3" - southeastern temperate; "5" - non Australian

**General phylogenetic clades:** "o" - outgroup; "ag" - clade A to G; "h3" - clade H3; "h10" - clade H10; "h11" - clade H11; "h12" - clade H12; "h14" - clade H14 and "h" - remaining clade H associated taxa.

Quality check samples (pooled sample) are in any case indicated with "QC".

## *In silico* predicted spectral database for Eremophila related metabolites

The file "20200222_Eremophila_ISDB.tsv" was used within the Network Annotation Propagation workflow on GNPS to achieve an enhanced chemical classification of the studied spectral dataset derived from Myoporeae species.

The file "20200222_Eremophila_ISDB.txt" contains the underlying SMILES strings and compound identifiers used to establish this spectral database. Compound names of "Singab_#" relate to compounds presented in Singab et al. 2013 chemical review, whereas "KU" compounds are presented in Table S6 within the manuscript.
